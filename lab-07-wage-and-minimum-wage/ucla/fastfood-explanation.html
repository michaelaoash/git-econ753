GENERAL EXPLANATION OF THE STUDY
================================

The accompanying data were used to study the effects of an increase in the 
minimum wage on unemployment. According to conventional economic theory, 
perfectly competitive employers will always cut their work force in 
response to any rise in the minimum wage. In practice, however, 
employer reactions are not so clear-cut: While some studies in the 
seventies confirmed the predictions of theory, earlier studies from the 
sixties, as well as more recent studies conducted in the early nineties, 
concluded that employment was unaffected by increases in the minimum wage.

This study sought to clarify the issue. The New Jersey minimum wage 
increase of April 1, 1992, which raised the minimum wage from $4.25 to 
$5.05, provided a perfect opportunity. Because the fast-food industry 
employs predominantly low-wage workers, because the absence of tips 
simplifies the measurement of wages, and because fast-food restaurants are 
relatively easy to sample, the study chose to assess the effects of the 
minimum wage increase on a random sample of Burger King, Wendys, KFC, and 
Roy Rogers restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. The 
restaurants were interviewed about one month before, and about eight 
months after, the wage increase went into effect. Information was 
collected at each restaurant about variables such as the number of 
employees, various product prices, and store hours. This data provided 
everything necessary to calculate the impact that the minimum wage 
increase made not only on employment rates, but also on food prices, which
can always be raised to compensate for higher wages. Finally, since 
unemployment is affected by factors other than the minimum wage, the study 
made careful use of controls. The data from the restaurants in Pennsylvania,
as well as data on a number of restaurants in New Jersey that had been 
using the new five dollar minimum wage as a base salary even before the 
official increase went into effect, provided these naturally.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA          
=============================

The final data set contains information on 410 restaurants randomly chosen
from phonebooks in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. For each 
restaurant information is provided on 46 variables; about half pertain 
to the period before the minimum wage increase, and about half concern the
period after.  

After it was chosen from the phonebook, each restaurant was called for a 
telephone survey. To elicit a response restaurants were called back as 
many as nine times, and the researchers obtained 410 completed interviews--
an 87 percent response rate.
